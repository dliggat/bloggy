## README

This is a very basic Rails app used to demonstrate the process of using `rubber` to deploy a full **{Nginx, Passenger, PostgreSQL}** stack on Amazon Web Services.

It is referenced extensively in [this blog post](http://liggat.org/2014/12/13/a-full-AWS-rails-stack-provision-and-deployment-with-the-rubber-gem/) of mine.
